## Overview

> Vagrant up is the new make build.  
[@choult]

Vagrant is a tool for managing development environments. By abstracting the management of virtual machines and their configurations, it provides a way to consistently set up simple machines or complex environments independently of the hosting platform. See [the official introduction][VagrantWhy] for more details.

The repository contains the following environments:

* [Playground]
* [Workstations]

The environments use custom [base boxes] for [Virtualbox], built using [Packer] and hosted in [Atlas].
